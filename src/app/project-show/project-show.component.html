    Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are one of the highest energy events in the
	universe but little is known about them. The sources and the mechanisms
	of emission have been studied for many years but are still not very clearly
	understood. The temporal profiles of Gamma-Ray Burst can provide clues
	about the very nature of GRBs. In this project we aimed to find the temporal
	characteristics of the Gamma-Ray Burst 190114C which is a recently detected
	GRB in the Tera-electron Volt (TeV) energy range. The temporal profile
	of this GRB hasn't been studied in detail as of now. For our analysis we
	have used data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, have utilized
	softwares like Rmfit for background-fitting and Pyroot along with Norris-
	2005 temporal model for curve-fitting procedures. The time evolution of
	the GRB 190141C suggested that width of a pulse increases and amplitude
	decreases with time. We also got an inverse relationship between the rise
	and fall duration of a pulse and no correlation between the pulse width and
	asymmetry...

    <p>
    Pakistan has a history of droughts, most notable was during the period 1998-2000. The Southern parts of the country below 30ºN, particularly parts of Southern Punjab, Sindh & Balochistan, are the most vulnerable regions to droughts in Pakistan. Because of the long latitudinal extent of the country from 24ºN to 37ºN, the country has a diversified climate which consist mostly of arid and semiarid regions, besides some hyper arid regions. On account of the natural deserts within 25º to 30ºN there are two rainy seasons namely winter (December to March) and summer monsoons (June to September) and two transition periods having almost insignificant rains. The rainfall pattern is highly variable and climate change might have adverse impact on the drought conditions in Pakistan...
